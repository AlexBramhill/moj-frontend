To make your service consistent with GOV.UK, you should:

- use the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) 
- follow the [government design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles).
- use the MOJ Pattern Library (if you can't find what you need in the GOV.UK Design System)

## About the MOJ Pattern Library 

The MOJ Pattern Library brings together the latest research, design and development of reusable [components](./components) and [patterns](./patterns) created by designers and developers at MOJ.

We need everyone to help improve the work in the Pattern Library. If you have research findings, designs or code to contribute, share it on the <a href="https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CH5RUSB27" class="govuk-link">#moj-design-system-support</a> channel on Slack.</p>
