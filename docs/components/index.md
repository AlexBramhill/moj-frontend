Components in this section have been created by designers and developers at MOJ.

To contribute your research findings, designs or code, share it on the <a href="https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CH5RUSB27" class="govuk-link">#moj-design-system-support</a> channel on Slack.</p>

If a similar component is in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/), you should use that component instead. The MOJ version will become a [retired component](retired-components).
