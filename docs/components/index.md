Read about components in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/).

If a similar component is published in the GOV.UK Design System, you should use that component instead. The MOJ component become a [retired component](retired-components).

If you are using [Ministry of Justice Frontend](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend) in your prototype kit or in your build, the coded examples provided will render exactly as they do inside the Design System.



<!-- See all the [components in the backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system-backlog/issues). -->
