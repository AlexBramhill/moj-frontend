## When to use

Use the add another component when you need to let users enter variations of information multiple times, such as several names for a single application.

## When not to use

Don’t use the add another component if you need to let users enter information which varies differently or is not similar. Or if one field is dependent on the answer to the previous.

## How to use

The add another component uses JavaScript. When JavaScript is not available, the page will reload with the additional form elements added to the page.

## Research

This component has been tested in prototypes of several citizen and internal products, including:

- Claim fees for Crown court defence (Legal Aid Agency)
- Moving People Safely (Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service)
