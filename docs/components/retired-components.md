title: Retired components

These components are now published in the GOV.UK Design System. You should use the GOV.UK Design System component instead.

### Contents

- [Currency input](#currency-input)
- [Tag](#tag)
  
## Currency input

[Currency input](../currency-input) is retired. 

You should use [prefixes and suffixes](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#prefixes-and-suffixes) in the GOV.UK Design System to help users enter things like currencies.

## Tag

Additional colours of [Tag](../tag) are retired.

The GOV.UK Design System working group [made a decision to use tints for additional colours](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/62#issuecomment-590800378).

You should use [additional colours](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/#additional-colours) in the GOV.UK Design System.
