To make your service consistent with GOV.UK, you should:

- use the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) 
- follow the [government design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles).
- use the MOJ Pattern Library (if you can't find what you need in the GOV.UK Design System)

## About the MOJ Pattern Library 

The MOJ Pattern Library brings together [components](./components) and [patterns](./patterns) created by designers and developers at MOJ.

To use these components and patterns you can either:

- copy the HTML code
- copy the Nunjucks code (if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)) 

To contribute your research findings, designs or code, share it on the <a href="https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CH5RUSB27" class="govuk-link">#moj-design-system-support</a> channel on Slack.</p>
