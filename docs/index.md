To make your service consistent with GOV.UK, you should:

- use the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) 
- follow the [government design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles).
- use the MOJ Pattern Library (if you can't find what you need in the GOV.UK Design System)

## About the MOJ Pattern Library 

The MOJ Pattern Library brings together [components](./components) and [patterns](./patterns) created by designers and developers at MOJ.
